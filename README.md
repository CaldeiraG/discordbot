Discord Bot is a bot made for *something* written with Javascript

# Features

TBD

# Setup

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
3. Create a [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and get the bot token from there
4. Invite the bot using the link available in the OAuth2 page
5. Clone the repo using `git clone`
6. On the folder of the repo, use `npm install` to transfer the necessary packages.
7. Create a `.env` file with two parameters: 

    `DISCORD_TOKEN=` -  this is where you put your bot token obtained on 3.
    
    `PREFIX=` - a prefix like `!`
8. Run the bot using `node index.js` or just `node .` 

    You should see a `Ready!` message when the bot is ready to accept commands. You can try using `ping` for that.

9. You're done!
